# Scalper Mode Instructions

**Trading Style:** Quick in-and-out trades with tight stops. Focus on short-term price movements, high-frequency opportunities, and rapid execution.

## Key Characteristics

- **Timeframes:** 1-5 minute charts (primary), tick charts for entries
- **Trade Frequency:** High frequency (10-30+ trades per day possible)
- **Entry Focus:** Short-term price movements and micro-patterns
- **Exit Strategy:** Quick profit targets, tight stops
- **Hold Time:** Seconds to minutes (typically 1-15 minutes)
- **Execution Speed:** Rapid - enter and exit quickly

## Entry Criteria

### Scalping Setups
1. **Micro-breakouts:** Price breaks above/below recent 1-5 minute range
2. **Order flow:** Bid/ask imbalance showing direction
3. **Level 2 depth:** Large orders at key levels (if available)
4. **Tick-by-tick momentum:** Rapid price movement in one direction
5. **VWAP touch:** Quick bounce/rejection off VWAP

### Volume Requirements
- **High volume essential:** 150K+ volume preferred
- **Volume spike:** Sudden volume increase on entry signal
- **Liquidity:** Only trade highly liquid instruments (SPY, QQQ, etc.)
- **Avoid:** Low-volume periods (early morning, lunch, late afternoon)

### Time-Based Rules
- **Best times:** 9:30-11:00 AM and 1:00-3:00 PM (highest volume)
- **Avoid:** 11:30 AM-1:00 PM (lunch compression - no edge)
- **Power hour (3:00-4:00 PM):** Can be profitable but higher risk

## Position Management

### Position Sizing
- **Standard size:** 1-2% of account per trade (smaller than day trading)
- **High conviction:** Up to 3% per trade
- **Maximum positions:** 2-3 concurrent positions (manageable for rapid exits)
- **Total exposure:** Max 6% of account at any time

### Stop Loss Rules (TIGHT)
- **Very tight stops:** 0.25-0.75% of entry price for stocks
- **Options:** 10-20% of premium paid (tighter than day trading)
- **ATR-based:** 1.0x 1-minute ATR (tighter than day trading)
- **Mental stops:** Often exit before stop is hit if momentum fails
- **Never widen stops** - if wrong, exit immediately

### Profit Targets (QUICK)
- **Quick targets:** 0.25R to 0.5R (25-50% of risk)
- **Scalp profits:** Take profits quickly, don't wait for big moves
- **Partial exits:** Take 50-75% at first target, trail remainder
- **Full exit:** At 0.5R or if momentum stalls (whichever comes first)

## Exit Strategy

### Quick Exit Rules
1. **Profit target hit:** Exit immediately at target
2. **Momentum stalls:** If price stops moving, exit
3. **Stop hit:** Exit at stop loss (automatic)
4. **Time-based:** If position hasn't moved in 5-10 minutes, exit
5. **Volume dries up:** If volume decreases, exit
6. **Opposite signal:** If opposite setup forms, exit current position

### No Overnight Holds
- **Close ALL positions by end of day** (same as day trading)
- **No exceptions** - scalping is intraday only
- **End of day:** Close by 3:50 PM ET

## Risk Management

### Daily Limits
- **Max loss per day:** 1.5% of account (tighter than day trading)
- **Max trades per day:** 30 trades maximum (high frequency)
- **After 3 consecutive losses:** Reduce position size by 50%
- **After 5 consecutive losses:** Stop trading for 30 minutes, reassess
- **After 7 consecutive losses:** Stop trading for the day

### Position Limits
- **Max concurrent positions:** 3 positions (fewer than day trading)
- **Max total exposure:** 6% of account (tighter than day trading)
- **Reserve cash:** Always maintain 40% cash reserve (higher than day trading)

### Win Rate Focus
- **Target win rate:** 60-70% (higher than day trading due to quick exits)
- **Risk/Reward:** 1:0.5 to 1:1 (smaller R:R, but higher win rate)
- **Consistency:** Many small wins > few large wins

## Execution Guidelines

### Order Types
- **Entry:** Market orders or limit orders very close to current price
- **Stop:** Stop orders (automatic execution, tight)
- **Target:** Limit orders at profit targets (quick fills)
- **Time in Force:** Day orders only, or IOC (Immediate or Cancel)

### Monitoring (INTENSIVE)
- **Active monitoring:** Watch positions continuously (every 1-2 minutes)
- **Set alerts:** Tight price alerts at stop and target levels
- **Volume watch:** Monitor volume continuously for exit signals
- **Time awareness:** Know exactly how long position has been open

### Execution Speed
- **Fast entries:** Enter immediately when setup forms
- **Fast exits:** Exit immediately when target/stop hit or momentum stalls
- **No hesitation:** Scalping requires quick decision-making
- **Practice:** Develop muscle memory for common setups

## Pattern Recognition

### High-Probability Scalping Patterns
1. **Micro-breakout:** 1-2 minute breakout from tight range
2. **VWAP touch:** Quick bounce/rejection off VWAP
3. **Order flow:** Bid/ask pressure showing direction
4. **Tick momentum:** Rapid price movement with volume
5. **Failed test:** Quick rejection of level, reverse trade

### Avoid These Patterns
1. **Choppy/consolidation:** No clear micro-direction
2. **Low volume:** <100K volume (not enough liquidity)
3. **Wide spreads:** High bid/ask spread (slippage risk)
4. **Lunch compression:** Avoid 11:30 AM-1:00 PM
5. **End of day (after 3:45 PM):** Too risky for scalping

## Session Management

### Morning Session (9:30-11:00 AM)
- **Best scalping time:** Highest volume, most opportunities
- **Focus:** Opening range breakouts, VWAP crosses
- **Strategy:** Trade with initial momentum

### Lunch Session (11:30 AM-1:00 PM)
- **AVOID SCALPING** during lunch compression
- **No edge:** Low volume, choppy price action
- **Use time:** Review morning trades, plan afternoon strategy

### Afternoon Session (1:00-3:00 PM)
- **Good scalping time:** Volume picks up
- **Focus:** Breakouts from lunch consolidation
- **Strategy:** Trade momentum continuation

### Power Hour (3:00-4:00 PM)
- **Caution:** High volatility, potential for reversals
- **Strategy:** Only scalp clear momentum, reduce size
- **Exit all positions by 3:50 PM** - no exceptions

## Mental Discipline

### Scalping Requires
- ✅ **Quick decisions** - Enter and exit fast
- ✅ **Discipline** - Stick to tight stops and quick targets
- ✅ **Focus** - Active monitoring of positions
- ✅ **Patience** - Wait for high-probability setups
- ✅ **Emotional control** - Don't revenge trade after losses
- ✅ **Consistency** - Many small wins add up

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Holding too long** - Scalping is quick, not swing trading
2. **Widening stops** - If wrong, exit immediately
3. **Overtrading** - Quality over quantity
4. **Trading low volume** - Need liquidity for quick exits
5. **Revenge trading** - After loss, take a break

## Summary

Scalping requires:
- ✅ **Ultra-quick execution** - Enter and exit in minutes
- ✅ **Tight risk control** - Small stops, quick targets
- ✅ **High frequency** - Many trades, small profits
- ✅ **Active monitoring** - Watch positions continuously
- ✅ **Volume focus** - Only trade high-volume periods
- ✅ **Mental discipline** - Quick decisions, no hesitation

**Remember:** Scalping is about consistency and frequency. Many small wins (0.25R-0.5R) add up to significant daily profits. Don't try to turn scalps into home runs - take profits quickly and move to the next setup.
