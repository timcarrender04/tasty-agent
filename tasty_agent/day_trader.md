# Day Trader Mode Instructions

**Trading Style:** Multiple trades per day with clear entry/exit rules. Focus on intraday patterns, momentum, and end-of-day position management.

## Key Characteristics

- **Timeframes:** Intraday positions only (must close by end of day)
- **Trade Frequency:** Multiple setups per day (3-10 trades typical)
- **Entry Focus:** Momentum-based entries on intraday patterns
- **Exit Strategy:** End-of-day exits (close all positions before market close)
- **Hold Time:** Minutes to hours (never overnight)
- **Timeframe Analysis:** 1-5 minute charts for entries, 15-minute for context

## Entry Criteria

### Momentum Entries
1. **Price breaks above/below key intraday levels** with volume confirmation
2. **VWAP cross with momentum** - price crosses VWAP with increasing volume
3. **Breakout from consolidation** - price breaks from tight range with volume spike
4. **Pullback to support/resistance** - price pulls back to key level and bounces/rejects

### Volume Requirements
- **Minimum 100K+ volume** on entry signal
- **Volume increasing** on breakout/breakdown
- **Avoid low-volume periods** (lunch compression, early morning)

### Time-Based Rules
- **Best entries:** 9:30-11:30 AM and 1:00-3:30 PM
- **Avoid:** 11:30 AM-1:00 PM (lunch compression)
- **Power hour (3:00-4:00 PM):** Trade with caution, focus on momentum continuation

## Position Management

### Position Sizing
- **Standard size:** 2-3% of account per trade
- **High conviction (85%+):** Up to 5% per trade
- **Maximum positions:** 3-5 concurrent positions
- **Total exposure:** Max 15% of account at any time

### Stop Loss Rules
- **Tight stops:** 0.5-1.5% of entry price for stocks
- **Options:** 15-25% of premium paid
- **ATR-based:** 1.5x 5-minute ATR for precise stops
- **Never move stop against position** - only tighten

### Profit Targets
- **Quick targets:** 0.5R to 1R (50-100% of risk)
- **Partial exits:** Take 50% at 0.5R, trail remainder
- **Full exit:** At 1R or end of day (whichever comes first)

## Exit Strategy

### End-of-Day Rules (CRITICAL)
1. **Close ALL positions by 3:50 PM ET** (10 minutes before close)
2. **No overnight holds** - this is day trading, not swing trading
3. **If position is profitable:** Close to lock in gains
4. **If position is at loss:** Close to prevent overnight gap risk
5. **Exception:** Only if position is at significant profit (>2R) and trend is strong, consider holding 1-2 minutes into close

### Intraday Exit Signals
1. **Target hit:** Close at profit target
2. **Stop hit:** Close at stop loss
3. **Momentum reversal:** Large opposite-color candle with volume
4. **Time-based:** If position hasn't moved in 30-60 minutes, consider exit
5. **Volume dries up:** If volume decreases significantly, exit

## Risk Management

### Daily Limits
- **Max loss per day:** 2% of account (stop trading if hit)
- **Max trades per day:** 10 trades maximum
- **After 2 consecutive losses:** Reduce position size by 50%
- **After 3 consecutive losses:** Stop trading for the day

### Position Limits
- **Max concurrent positions:** 5 positions
- **Max total exposure:** 15% of account
- **Reserve cash:** Always maintain 30% cash reserve

## Session Management

### Morning Session (9:30-11:30 AM)
- **Focus:** Identify day's trend and key levels
- **Strategy:** Trade with the trend established in first 30 minutes
- **Best setups:** VWAP crosses, breakouts from opening range

### Lunch Session (11:30 AM-1:00 PM)
- **Avoid trading** during lunch compression
- **Watch for:** Consolidation patterns forming
- **Prepare for:** Afternoon breakout direction

### Afternoon Session (1:00-3:30 PM)
- **Focus:** Momentum continuation or reversal
- **Strategy:** Trade breakouts from lunch consolidation
- **Best setups:** Trend continuation, failed reversals

### Power Hour (3:00-4:00 PM)
- **Caution:** High volatility, potential for reversals
- **Strategy:** Only trade clear momentum continuation
- **Exit all positions by 3:50 PM** - no exceptions

## Pattern Recognition

### High-Probability Day Trading Patterns
1. **Opening Range Breakout:** Break above/below first 15-30 minute range
2. **VWAP Pullback:** Price pulls back to VWAP, bounces/rejects
3. **Double Top/Bottom:** Failed breakout, reversal trade
4. **Trend Continuation:** Higher highs/lower lows with volume
5. **Failed Breakdown/Breakout:** Trap pattern, quick reversal

### Avoid These Patterns
1. **Choppy/consolidation:** No clear direction
2. **Low volume:** <70K volume on signal
3. **Near HOD/LOD:** Within 0.4% of day's high/low
4. **Lunch compression:** Tight range, low volume
5. **End of day (after 3:45 PM):** Too risky for new entries

## Execution Guidelines

### Order Types
- **Entry:** Limit orders at key levels (better fills)
- **Stop:** Stop orders (automatic execution)
- **Target:** Limit orders at profit targets
- **Time in Force:** Day orders only (no GTC for day trading)

### Monitoring
- **Active monitoring:** Watch positions every 5-15 minutes
- **Set alerts:** Price alerts at stop and target levels
- **Volume watch:** Monitor volume for exit signals
- **Time awareness:** Always know time remaining until close

## Summary
