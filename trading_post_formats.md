📈 Quick Trading Recap: AAPL Options Momentum Scalp

Today I executed a short-term momentum play on AAPL options that I want to share for educational purposes.

⚡ The Strategy:
• Two-leg position: AAPL Jan 16 calls at $240 and $245 strikes
• Entry window: 8:03-8:08 PM ET
• Exit window: 8:25-8:36 PM ET
• Total holding time: ~33 minutes

📊 The Results:
• 4 total trades (2 entries, 2 exits)
• Net profit: +$128
• ROI: 4.1%
• Win rate: 100%
• Total fees: $2.00

🎯 What I Learned:
1. Quick profit-taking beats holding for maximum moves
2. Scaling in with multiple strikes improved risk/reward
3. Discipline on exits prevented giving back profits

This wasn't a home run trade, but it demonstrates the power of disciplined momentum trading - identify setups, execute quickly, and take profits at reasonable targets.

Key takeaway: Not every trade needs to be a grand slam. Consistent, disciplined smaller wins compound over time.

**AAPL Momentum Scalp - Quick Play-by-Play**

Just wrapped up a quick momentum play on AAPL options. Thought I'd share for discussion:

**The Setup:**
- AAPL Jan 16, 2026 weekly calls
- $240 and $245 strikes
- Extended hours trading

**The Trades:**
1. 8:03 PM: BTO $240C @ $18.05
2. 8:08 PM: BTO $245C @ $13.35
3. 8:25 PM: STC $240C @ $18.25 (+$20)
4. 8:36 PM: STC $245C @ $14.45 (+$110)

**Results:**
- Net profit: +$128
- ROI: 4.1%
- Holding time: 33 minutes
- Fees: $2.00

**Thoughts:**
Pretty clean execution. The $245 call performed much better (+8.2%) than the $240 (+1.1%). Took profits quickly rather than holding for maximum move - probably left some money on the table but locked in gains.

What do you think about the strike selection? Would you have held longer or taken profits earlier?
